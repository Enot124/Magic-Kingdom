# Tower-Defence

 "Magic Kingdom: Merge and Defend" is an exciting tower defense arcade game with "merge" mechanics! Defend the castle, level up the Mages and defeat the main Boss!<br><br>
You have to protect the royal castle from monsters! To do this, you have 4 Mages in your arsenal, each with their own element and their own characteristics. Merge Mages to create the greatest Mage and destroy all evil spirits! For the money accumulated from the battle, increase the level of magicians and defeat the main Boss!<br>
At the moment there are 3 worlds in the game, but in the future there will be more and more.<br>

Control:<br>
In this game, the controls are implemented in a simple way - you buy Mages for mana, which accumulates over time, unite Mages of the same element and fusion level and protect the tower from enemies.

Survive 3 minutes under the onslaught of monsters and their main Boss will appear! By killing him, you pass the level and get the opportunity to move to another world.

Loss occurs when the monster reaches the royal castle.

Initially, you fail to defend yourself and the enemies still break through. Don't worry, with the money accumulated in battle you can upgrade the Mages in the store and thereby increase your chance of winning!
